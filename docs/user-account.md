# User account

## Do I need an account to use Dentest?

Well, actually, it depends on what you want to do. If you just want to consult the documentation of 
public projects, you don't need one. But if you want to do anything else, yes.

## Create the account

To create an account on Dentest, you have to go through https://dentest.tech/register. For now,
there is no social login. 

We only need three pieces information, we don't care about your name, we don't care about where 
you live, and we don't care about having thousands of ways of contacting you. All we need is the
strict minimum: 

- a **username**, that will be publicly shown
- an **email**, that will never be shown to anyone on the platform, and exclusively used for transactional emails, only 
  if you need it (for password reset for instance). We don't send newsletters, and never will.
- a **password**, to authenticate yourself on the platform

## Is my personal info going anywhere?

No. No tracking, no ads, nothing. We only have your email address, and we won't do anything with it.

## Can I change my username, my password or my email?

Yes. When you're logged in, click on your username in the nav bar. You'll see a form to update your personal info.

## Can I delete my account?

Of course. And once your account is deleted, we don't keep anything about you. The user entry is deleted, and all your 
project and organizations participations as well. You're totally forgotten.

To delete your account, click on your username in the nav bar. You'll see a button "Delete account".
