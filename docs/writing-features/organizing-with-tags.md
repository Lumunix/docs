# Organizing with tags

Another way of organizing your resources on Dentest is by creating tags.

Tags can be associated to **features** themselves, **scenarios**, or even **steps**. Just search them in the associated autocomplete 
input to add them, or delete them using the "delete" key.

:new: To create a new tag, type its name in the autocomplete input, and hit "CTRL + Enter'. You'll then be able to 
select the color of the chip before its creation.
