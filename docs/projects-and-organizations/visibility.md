# Visibility

## Organization

An organization is always public. Everybody can access an organization's page. But what the users will
see there depends on the settings of the organization's projects themselves.

## Project

A project can have two levels of visibility:

- **Public**: everybody will see the project and its features content, whether they're logged in or not.
- **Private**: only the authenticated users who are part of the project will be able to see the project's content.

Projects that live inside organizations can benefit from a third level of visibility:

- **Internal**: only the authenticated users who are part of the organization will be able to see the project's content.
