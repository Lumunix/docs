# Project or organization?

Dentest offers two ways of organizing your work, that are projects and organizations. The main difference is a hierarchy
level. An organization holds several projects. In the common usage, companies will prefer the
organization mode to host all their projects. Side-projects or open-source projects may select
the "project" mode instead.

We recommend creating a project on Dentest per technical project you're dealing with.
